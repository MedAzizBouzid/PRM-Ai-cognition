0,0,5.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Identify Risks Process,,"A risk cannot be managed unless it is ﬁ rst identiﬁ ed. Consequently, after risk management planning has
been completed, the ﬁ rst process in the iterative Project Risk Management process aims to identify all the
knowable risks to project objectives.
It is, however, impossible to identify all the risks at the outset of a project. Over time, the level of project
risk exposure changes as a result of the decisions and actions taken previously in the project (internal change)
and of externally imposed change.
The purpose of risk identiﬁ cation is to identify risks to the maximum extent that is practicable. The fact that
some risks are unknowable or emergent requires the Identify Risk process to be iterative, repeating the Identify
Risks process to ﬁ nd new risks which have become knowable since the previous iteration of the process.
When a risk is ﬁ rst identiﬁ ed, potential responses may also be identiﬁ ed at the same time. These should be
recorded during the Identify Risks process and considered for immediate action if such action is appropriate.
Where such responses are not implemented immediately, these should be considered during the Plan Risk
Responses process.",A risk cannot be managed unless it is i rest identic edh consequently after risk management planning has been completed the i rest process in the iterative Project Risk Management process aims to identify all the knowable risks to project objectives It is however impossible to identify all the risks at the outset of a project Over time the level of project risk exposure changes as a result of the decisions and actions taken previously in the project internal change and of externally imposed change The purpose of risk identic cation is to identify risks to the maximum extent that is practicable The fact that some risks are unknowable or emergent requires the Identify Risk process to be iterative repeating the Identify Risks process to i and new risks which have become knowable since the previous iteration of the process When a risk is i rest identic edh potential responses may also be identic end at the same time These should be recorded during the Identify Risks process and considered for immediate action if such action is appropriate Where such responses are not implemented immediately these should be considered during the Plan Risk Responses process,a risk cannot be managed unless it is i rest identic edh consequently after risk management planning has been completed the i rest process in the iterative project risk management process aims to identify all the knowable risks to project objectives it is however impossible to identify all the risks at the outset of a project over time the level of project risk exposure changes as a result of the decisions and actions taken previously in the project internal change and of externally imposed change the purpose of risk identic cation is to identify risks to the maximum extent that is practicable the fact that some risks are unknowable or emergent requires the identify risk process to be iterative repeating the identify risks process to i and new risks which have become knowable since the previous iteration of the process when a risk is i rest identic edh potential responses may also be identic end at the same time these should be recorded during the identify risks process and considered for immediate action if such action is appropriate where such responses are not implemented immediately these should be considered during the plan risk responses process,risk managed rest edh risk management planning completed rest process project risk management process aims identify risks project objectives identify risks outset project time level project risk exposure changes result decisions actions taken project change imposed change purpose risk cation identify risks extent fact risks requires identify risk process repeating identify risks process risks become iteration process risk rest responses end time recorded risks process considered action action responses implemented considered plan risk responses process,"{('identify', 'risk'): 5, ('risk', 'process'): 3, ('risk', 'management'): 2, ('project', 'risk'): 2, ('process', 'risk'): 2, ('risk', 'managed'): 1, ('managed', 'rest'): 1, ('rest', 'edh'): 1, ('edh', 'risk'): 1, ('management', 'planning'): 1}","{('identify', 'risk', 'process'): 2, ('risk', 'managed', 'rest'): 1, ('managed', 'rest', 'edh'): 1, ('rest', 'edh', 'risk'): 1, ('edh', 'risk', 'management'): 1, ('risk', 'management', 'planning'): 1, ('management', 'planning', 'completed'): 1, ('planning', 'completed', 'rest'): 1, ('completed', 'rest', 'process'): 1, ('rest', 'process', 'project'): 1}","{'risk': 15, 'process': 7, 'project': 5, 'identify': 5, 'rest': 3, 'change': 3, 'action': 3, 'response': 3, 'management': 2, 'time': 2}"

that uncertainty is high in the initial stages of a project so there is often less information on which to base the
risk identiﬁ cation. Early risk identiﬁ cation enables key project decisions to take maximum account of risks
inherent in the project, and may result in changes to the project strategy. It also maximizes the time available
for development and implementation of risk responses, which enhances efﬁ ciency since responses taken early
are often normally less costly than later ones.

15,15,5.3.3 Creativity Techniques,,"A wide range of creativity techniques can be used for risk identiﬁ cation, which encourages project
stakeholders to use their imagination to ﬁ nd risks which might affect the project. The outcomes or effectiveness
of these techniques depend on the ability of participants to think creatively. These techniques can be used
either singly or in groups, and employ varying degrees of structure. These techniques depend on the ability of
participants to think creatively, and their success is enhanced by use of a skilled facilitator.
Each category of risk identiﬁ cation technique has strengths and weaknesses, and no single technique
can be expected to reveal all knowable risks. Consequently, the Identify Risks process for a particular project
should use a combination of techniques, perhaps selecting one from each category. For example, a project may
choose to use a risk identiﬁ cation checklist (historical review), together with assumptions analysis (current
assessment) and brainstorming (creativity).
Use of a risk breakdown structure which organizes the categories of potential risks on the project, a prompt
list, or a set of generic list categories may assist in ensuring that as many sources of risk as practicable have
been addressed, while recognizing that no such tools are complete nor can they replace original thinking.

CHAPTER 5 − IDENTIFY RISKS
Whichever risk identiﬁ cation techniques are used, it is important that identiﬁ ed risks are unambiguously
described in order to ensure that the project risk process is focused on the actual risks and not distracted or
diluted by non-risks. Use of structured risk descriptions can ensure clarity. Risk meta-language offers a useful
way of distinguishing a risk from its cause(s) and effect(s), describing each risk using three-part statements in
the form: “As a result of cause, risk may occur, which would lead to effect.” The relationship between cause,
risk, and effect is shown in Figure 5-2.
