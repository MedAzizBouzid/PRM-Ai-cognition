0,0,8.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Plan Risk Responses Process,,"The objective of the Plan Risk Responses process is to determine the set of actions which most enhance the
chances of project success while complying with applicable organizational and project constraints.
Once risks have been identiﬁ ed, analyzed, and prioritized, plans should be developed for addressing every
risk the project team considers to be sufﬁ ciently important, either because of the threat it poses to the project
objectives or the opportunity it offers. The planning entails agreeing upon the actions to be taken and the
potential changes to budget, schedule, resources, and scope which these actions might cause.
Contingent risk response actions need to be executed at the optimum time. For this reason, the response
speciﬁ cation for each such risk should include a description of any corresponding trigger conditions.
The responsibility for monitoring the project conditions and implementing the corresponding actions should
be clearly assigned. Every risk should have been allocated to a risk owner as part of the Identify Risks process,
and each of the corresponding risk responses should now be assigned to a speciﬁ c risk action owner. The risk
owner is responsible for ensuring that the risk response is effective and for planning additional risk responses
if required, whereas the risk action owner is responsible for ensuring that the agreed-upon risk responses are
carried out as planned, in a timely manner. The role of the risk owner and that of the risk action owner may be
assigned to a single person.
Responses, when implemented, can have potential effects on the project objectives and, as such, can
generate additional risks. These are known as secondary risks and have to be analyzed and planned for in the
same way as those risks which were initially identiﬁ ed.
It is never feasible or even desirable to eliminate all threats from a project. Similarly, there is also a limit
to the extent to which opportunities can be proactively managed. There may be residual risks that will remain
after the responses have been implemented. These residual risks should be clearly identiﬁ ed, analyzed,
documented, and communicated to all relevant stakeholders.

CHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES
All the approved, unconditional actions arising from risk response planning should be integrated into the
project management plan in order to ensure that they are carried out as part of normal project implementation. The
corresponding organizational and project management rules should also be invoked, including the following:
Project change management and conﬁ guration control;
•
Project planning, budgeting, and scheduling;
•
Resource management; and
•
Project communication planning.

Categorization of risks, for example by using tools such as the risk breakdown structure, afﬁ nity diagram, or
other categorizing tools, may help identify and address this situation. There is also a need during the Plan Risk
Responses process to consider the risks aggregated during the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process
(e.g., ten small, related risks combined may pose a big risk to the project), and then to develop generic
responses where possible. Another interaction effect that may occur is when one risk, if it occurs, may affect
the probability or impact of other risks.
Deciding on the response strategy may require a compromise, since some proposed responses may be
mutually exclusive or counterproductive. For example mitigating a threat to time could cost money, thereby
increasing pressure on the budget. Risk response planning also needs to take a holistic view of all proposed
responses and make sure they are coherent.

CHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES
The challenge therefore in planning responses to risks is the need to control the potential effects of the
strategy developed for treating the original risk. If this is overlooked, the total level of threat in a project can
actually increase, or the potential for opportunities can be compromised.","Responses may be developed to address risks related either by cause and effect or by common root cause Categorization of risks for example by using tools such as the risk breakdown structure aft city diagram or other categorizing tools may help identify and address this situation There is also a need during the Plan Risk Responses process to consider the risks aggregated during the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process (e.g., ten small related risks combined may pose a big risk to the project and then to develop generic responses where possible Another interaction effect that may occur is when one risk if it occurs may affect the probability or impact of other risks Deciding on the response strategy may require a compromise since some proposed responses may be mutually exclusive or counterproductive For example mitigating a threat to time could cost money thereby increasing pressure on the budget Risk response planning also needs to take a holistic view of all proposed responses and make sure they are coherent 46 8 CHAPTER 8 i PLAN RISK RESPONSES The challenge therefore in planning responses to risks is the need to control the potential effects of the strategy developed for treating the original risk If this is overlooked the total level of threat in a project can actually increase or the potential for opportunities can be compromised",responses may be developed to address risks related either by cause and effect or by common root cause categorization of risks for example by using tools such as the risk breakdown structure aft city diagram or other categorizing tools may help identify and address this situation there is also a need during the plan risk responses process to consider the risks aggregated during the perform quantitative risk analysis process e g ten small related risks combined may pose a big risk to the project and then to develop generic responses where possible another interaction effect that may occur is when one risk if it occurs may affect the probability or impact of other risks deciding on the response strategy may require a compromise since some proposed responses may be mutually exclusive or counterproductive for example mitigating a threat to time could cost money thereby increasing pressure on the budget risk response planning also needs to take a holistic view of all proposed responses and make sure they are coherent 46 8 chapter 8 i plan risk responses the challenge therefore in planning responses to risks is the need to control the potential effects of the strategy developed for treating the original risk if this is overlooked the total level of threat in a project can actually increase or the potential for opportunities can be compromised,responses developed address risks related cause effect root cause categorization risks example using tools risk breakdown structure aft city diagram categorizing tools help identify address situation need plan risk responses process consider risks aggregated perform risk analysis process e g ten risks combined pose risk project develop responses interaction effect occur risk occurs affect probability impact risks deciding response strategy require compromise proposed responses example mitigating threat time cost money increasing pressure budget risk response planning needs take view proposed responses make chapter plan risk responses challenge planning responses risks need control effects strategy developed treating risk overlooked level threat project increase opportunities compromised,"{('risk', 'response'): 3, ('plan', 'risk'): 2, ('proposed', 'response'): 2, ('response', 'developed'): 1, ('developed', 'address'): 1, ('address', 'risk'): 1, ('risk', 'related'): 1, ('related', 'cause'): 1, ('cause', 'effect'): 1, ('effect', 'root'): 1}","{('plan', 'risk', 'response'): 2, ('response', 'developed', 'address'): 1, ('developed', 'address', 'risk'): 1, ('address', 'risk', 'related'): 1, ('risk', 'related', 'cause'): 1, ('related', 'cause', 'effect'): 1, ('cause', 'effect', 'root'): 1, ('effect', 'root', 'cause'): 1, ('root', 'cause', 'categorization'): 1, ('cause', 'categorization', 'risk'): 1}","{'risk': 14, 'response': 9, 'effect': 3, 'need': 3, 'developed': 2, 'address': 2, 'cause': 2, 'example': 2, 'tool': 2, 'plan': 2}"
