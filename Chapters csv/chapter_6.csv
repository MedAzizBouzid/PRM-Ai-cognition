0,0,6.1  Purpose and Objectives of the Perform Qualitative Risk,,"Analysis Process
The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process assesses and evaluates characteristics of individually
identiﬁ ed project risks and prioritizes risks based on agreed-upon characteristics.
Assessing individual risks using qualitative risk analysis evaluates the probability that each risk will occur
and the effect of each individual risk on the project objectives. As such it does not directly address the overall
risk to project objectives that results from the combined effect of all risks and their potential interactions with
each other. This can however be achieved through use of quantitative risk analysis techniques (see Chapter 7).
One step in the analysis is to categorize risks according to their sources or causes. If several risks arise
from a common source, sometimes called a root cause, risk responses may be more effective when they focus
on addressing this root cause.
Identifying common effects from groups of risks allows identiﬁ cation of the areas of greatest risk exposure
(e.g. to the project completion date, the budget, or a particular deliverable’s scope), facilitating risk response
focus in these areas.
The methods of qualitative risk analysis are applied to the list of risks created or updated by the Identify
Risks process to provide project management with the characteristics of the risks that have the most inﬂ uence
(positive or negative) on achieving the project’s objectives. Risks that are assessed as high priority to either
threaten or to enhance the achievement of project objectives will be an important focus in the Plan Risk
Responses process. They may be further analyzed, such as in the analysis of the overall project risk that is
discussed in Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process.",Analysis Process The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process assesses and evaluates characteristics of individually identic end project risks and prioritizes risks based on agreed-upon characteristics Assessing individual risks using qualitative risk analysis evaluates the probability that each risk will occur and the effect of each individual risk on the project objectives As such it does not directly address the overall risk to project objectives that results from the combined effect of all risks and their potential interactions with each other This can however be achieved through use of quantitative risk analysis techniques see Chapter 7).

address. Indicators of urgency can include the lead time necessary to execute a risk response and the
clarity of symptoms and warning signs (also known as detectability) that may trigger the response.

address them. The project team may examine these and decide to:
Go forward, perhaps establishing a contingency reserve.

magnitude of the risk event for the group as a whole along with effective strategies that might address several
risks simultaneously. Alternatively, some risks may be linked with others in a causal chain, and understanding
the chain of risks may lead to a better understanding of the implication of risk for the project. Identifying risks
that can occur at the same time or using the same resources for recovery might provide a realistic picture of
problems of risk mitigation using scarce resources.
Combining the results of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process with the risk breakdown structure
(see Identify Risks, Chapter 5) can show clusters of priority risks arising from speciﬁ c sources. A combination
of the risk analysis information with the work breakdown structure (WBS) can show which areas of the project
exhibit the most risk. Assessing the high-priority risks’ impact on one objective, such as the schedule, may
indicate which activities to address to reduce that objective’s uncertainty. All of these approaches can contribute
to the realism and usefulness of the qualitative risk analysis.",Categorizing risks appropriately may lead to improved analysis of the probability and magnitude of project risk and to effective responses Understanding the relationships between risks may provide a better understanding of the possibility and magnitude of project risk than if risks are only considered as separate and independent events Identifying common root causes of a group of risks for instance may reveal both the magnitude of the risk event for the group as a whole along with effective strategies that might address several risks simultaneously alternatively some risks may be linked with others in a causal chain and understanding the chain of risks may lead to a better understanding of the implication of risk for the project Identifying risks that can occur at the same time or using the same resources for recovery might provide a realistic picture of problems of risk mitigation using scarce resources Combining the results of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process with the risk breakdown structure see Identify risks Chapter i can show clusters of priority risks arising from specie c sources A combination of the risk analysis information with the work breakdown structure (WBS) can show which areas of the project exhibit the most risk Assessing the high-priority risks impact on one objective such as the schedule may indicate which activities to address to reduce that objectives uncertainty All of these approaches can contribute to the realism and usefulness of the qualitative risk analysis,categorizing risks appropriately may lead to improved analysis of the probability and magnitude of project risk and to effective responses understanding the relationships between risks may provide a better understanding of the possibility and magnitude of project risk than if risks are only considered as separate and independent events identifying common root causes of a group of risks for instance may reveal both the magnitude of the risk event for the group as a whole along with effective strategies that might address several risks simultaneously alternatively some risks may be linked with others in a causal chain and understanding the chain of risks may lead to a better understanding of the implication of risk for the project identifying risks that can occur at the same time or using the same resources for recovery might provide a realistic picture of problems of risk mitigation using scarce resources combining the results of the perform qualitative risk analysis process with the risk breakdown structure see identify risks chapter i can show clusters of priority risks arising from specie c sources a combination of the risk analysis information with the work breakdown structure wbs can show which areas of the project exhibit the most risk assessing the high priority risks impact on one objective such as the schedule may indicate which activities to address to reduce that objectives uncertainty all of these approaches can contribute to the realism and usefulness of the qualitative risk analysis,categorizing risks lead analysis probability magnitude project risk responses understanding relationships risks provide understanding possibility magnitude project risk risks considered events identifying root causes group risks instance reveal magnitude risk event group strategies address risks risks linked others causal chain understanding chain risks lead understanding implication risk project identifying risks occur time using resources recovery provide picture problems risk mitigation using resources combining results perform risk analysis process risk breakdown structure see risks chapter show clusters priority risks arising c sources combination risk analysis information work breakdown structure wbs show areas project exhibit assessing priority risks impact objective schedule indicate activities address reduce objectives uncertainty approaches contribute realism usefulness risk analysis,"{('risk', 'analysis'): 3, ('risk', 'lead'): 2, ('magnitude', 'project'): 2, ('project', 'risk'): 2, ('risk', 'risk'): 2, ('using', 'resource'): 2, ('breakdown', 'structure'): 2, ('priority', 'risk'): 2, ('categorizing', 'risk'): 1, ('lead', 'analysis'): 1}","{('magnitude', 'project', 'risk'): 2, ('categorizing', 'risk', 'lead'): 1, ('risk', 'lead', 'analysis'): 1, ('lead', 'analysis', 'probability'): 1, ('analysis', 'probability', 'magnitude'): 1, ('probability', 'magnitude', 'project'): 1, ('project', 'risk', 'response'): 1, ('risk', 'response', 'understanding'): 1, ('response', 'understanding', 'relationship'): 1, ('understanding', 'relationship', 'risk'): 1}","{'risk': 20, 'analysis': 4, 'project': 4, 'understanding': 4, 'magnitude': 3, 'lead': 2, 'provide': 2, 'event': 2, 'identifying': 2, 'group': 2}"
13,13,6.3.6 Document the Results of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process,,"The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process adds structure to the list of undifferentiated risks (see Identify
Risks, Chapter 5) into categories of priority. Priorities are usually based on the risk’s probability of occurring
and its potential impact on speciﬁ c project objectives or on the whole project. Each identiﬁ ed risk is assigned
a priority, perhaps by objective or for the entire project. This information is usually stored in the risk register
which is easy to use and update with new information. The risk register list of prioritized risks is posted to the
project participants who are responsible for further analysis or action to improve the project plan. Risks that
are judged to have high priority are segregated for further analysis and response planning and are generally
monitored frequently. Risks of low priority to the project may be placed on a watch list and are reviewed less
often for changes in their status.",The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process adds structure to the list of undifferentiated risks see Identify risks Chapter i into categories of priority Priorities are usually based on the risks probability of occurring and its potential impact on specie c project objectives or on the whole project Each identic end risk is assigned a priority perhaps by objective or for the entire project This information is usually stored in the risk register which is easy to use and update with new information The risk register list of prioritized risks is posted to the project participants who are responsible for further analysis or action to improve the project plan Risks that are judged to have high priority are segregated for further analysis and response planning and are generally monitored frequently Risks of low priority to the project may be placed on a watch list and are reviewed less often for changes in their status,the perform qualitative risk analysis process adds structure to the list of undifferentiated risks see identify risks chapter i into categories of priority priorities are usually based on the risks probability of occurring and its potential impact on specie c project objectives or on the whole project each identic end risk is assigned a priority perhaps by objective or for the entire project this information is usually stored in the risk register which is easy to use and update with new information the risk register list of prioritized risks is posted to the project participants who are responsible for further analysis or action to improve the project plan risks that are judged to have high priority are segregated for further analysis and response planning and are generally monitored frequently risks of low priority to the project may be placed on a watch list and are reviewed less often for changes in their status,perform risk analysis process adds structure list risks see risks chapter categories priority priorities based risks probability occurring impact specie c project objectives project end risk assigned priority objective project information stored risk register use update information risk register list risks posted project participants analysis action improve project plan risks judged priority segregated analysis response planning monitored risks priority project placed watch list reviewed changes status,"{('list', 'risk'): 2, ('objective', 'project'): 2, ('risk', 'register'): 2, ('perform', 'risk'): 1, ('risk', 'analysis'): 1, ('analysis', 'process'): 1, ('process', 'add'): 1, ('add', 'structure'): 1, ('structure', 'list'): 1, ('risk', 'see'): 1}","{('perform', 'risk', 'analysis'): 1, ('risk', 'analysis', 'process'): 1, ('analysis', 'process', 'add'): 1, ('process', 'add', 'structure'): 1, ('add', 'structure', 'list'): 1, ('structure', 'list', 'risk'): 1, ('list', 'risk', 'see'): 1, ('risk', 'see', 'risk'): 1, ('see', 'risk', 'chapter'): 1, ('risk', 'chapter', 'category'): 1}","{'risk': 10, 'project': 6, 'priority': 5, 'analysis': 3, 'list': 3, 'objective': 2, 'information': 2, 'register': 2, 'perform': 1, 'process': 1}"
