0,0,7.1  Purpose and Objectives of the Perform Quantitative Risk,,"Analysis Process
The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process provides a numerical estimate of the overall effect of risk on
the objectives of the project, based on current plans and information, when considering risks simultaneously.
Results from this type of analysis can be used to evaluate the likelihood of success in achieving project
objectives and to estimate contingency reserves, usually for time and cost that are appropriate to both the risks
and the risk tolerance of project stakeholders.
It is generally accepted that analyzing uncertainty in the project using quantitative techniques such as
Monte Carlo simulation may provide more realism in the estimate of the overall project cost or schedule
than a non-probabilistic approach which assumes that the activity durations or line-item cost estimates are
deterministic. However it should be recognized that quantitative risk analysis is not always required or appropriate
for all projects. For example, qualitative risk analysis may provide enough information for development of
effective risk responses, especially for smaller projects. Therefore, during the Plan Risk Management process,
the beneﬁ ts of quantitative risk analysis should be weighed against the effort required to ensure that the
additional insights and value justify the additional effort.
Partial risk analyses, such as qualitative risk analysis, aim at prioritizing individual risks viewed one at a time
and therefore cannot produce measures of overall project risk when all risks are considered simultaneously.
Calculating estimates of overall project risk is the focus of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process.
Speciﬁ c project risks are usually best understood and quantiﬁ ed at a detailed level such as the line-item
cost or schedule activity level. By contrast, project objectives such as achievement of the project’s budget or
the schedule are speciﬁ ed at a higher level, often at the level of the total project. An overall risk analysis, such
as one that uses quantitative techniques, estimates the implication of all quantiﬁ ed risks on project objectives.
The implementation of overall risk analysis using quantitative methods requires:
Complete and accurate representation of the project objectives built up from individual project
•
elements. Examples of these representations include the project schedule or cost estimate.
Identifying risks on individual project elements such as schedule activities or line-item costs at a
•
level of detail that lends itself to speciﬁ c assessment of individual risks.
Including generic risks that have a broader effect than individual project elements.
•
Applying a quantitative method (such as Monte Carlo simulation or decision tree analysis) that incorporates
•
multiple risks simultaneously in determining overall impact on the overall project objective.

CHAPTER 7 − PERFORM QUANTITATIVE RISK ANALYSIS
Results of the quantitative analysis will be compared to the project plan (baseline or current) to give
management an estimate of the overall project risk and will answer important questions such as:
What is the probability of meeting the project’s objectives?
•
How much contingency reserve (e.g., reserves or buffers of time, resources, and cost) is needed to
•
provide the organization with the level of certainty it requires based upon its risk tolerance?
What are those parts of the project, such as line-item costs or schedule activities, which contribute
•
the most risk when all risks are considered simultaneously?
Which individual risks contribute the most to overall project risk?
•
Estimating overall project risk using quantitative methods helps distinguish those projects where quantiﬁ ed
risks threaten objectives beyond the tolerance of the stakeholders, from those for which the objectives are
within acceptable tolerances even when risk is considered. The former may be targeted for vigorous risk
responses aimed at protecting those objectives most important to the stakeholders.

Probability of achieving a project objective such as ﬁ nishing on time or within budget.
•
Amount of contingency reserve in cost, time, or resources needed to provide a required level of
•
conﬁ dence.
Identity or location within the project model of the most important risks. An example of this is a

The contingency reserves calculated in quantitative project cost and schedule risk analysis are incorporated,
respectively, into the cost estimate and the schedule to establish a prudent target and a realistic expectation
for the project. Contingency reserves may also be established to provide for the capture of opportunities that
are judged to be priorities for the project. If the contingency reserve required exceeds the time or resources
available, changes in the project scope and plan may result.
Also, the results of the analysis may provide more or less urgency to risk response (see Plan Risk Responses,
Chapter 8) depending on the probability of achieving the plan’s objectives or the amount of contingency reserve
required to provide the necessary level of conﬁ dence. The results of a quantitative risk analysis are recorded
and passed on to the person and/or group responsible for project management within the organization for any
further actions required to make full use of these results.",Analysis Process The contingency reserves calculated in quantitative project cost and schedule risk analysis are incorporated respectively into the cost estimate and the schedule to establish a prudent target and a realistic expectation for the project Contingency reserves may also be established to provide for the capture of opportunities that are judged to be priorities for the project If the contingency reserve required exceeds the time or resources available changes in the project scope and plan may results also the results of the analysis may provide more or less urgency to risk response see Plan Risk responses Chapter i depending on the probability of achieving the plans objectives or the amount of contingency reserve required to provide the necessary level of con dance The results of a quantitative risk analysis are recorded and passed on to the person anchor group responsible for project management within the organization for any further actions required to make full use of these results,analysis process the contingency reserves calculated in quantitative project cost and schedule risk analysis are incorporated respectively into the cost estimate and the schedule to establish a prudent target and a realistic expectation for the project contingency reserves may also be established to provide for the capture of opportunities that are judged to be priorities for the project if the contingency reserve required exceeds the time or resources available changes in the project scope and plan may results also the results of the analysis may provide more or less urgency to risk response see plan risk responses chapter i depending on the probability of achieving the plans objectives or the amount of contingency reserve required to provide the necessary level of con dance the results of a quantitative risk analysis are recorded and passed on to the person anchor group responsible for project management within the organization for any further actions required to make full use of these results,analysis process contingency reserves calculated project cost schedule risk analysis incorporated cost estimate schedule establish target expectation project contingency reserves established provide capture opportunities judged priorities project contingency reserve required exceeds time resources changes project scope plan results results analysis provide risk response see plan risk responses chapter depending probability achieving plans objectives amount contingency reserve required provide level con dance results risk analysis recorded passed person anchor group project management organization actions required make use results,"{('contingency', 'reserve'): 4, ('risk', 'analysis'): 2, ('project', 'contingency'): 2, ('reserve', 'required'): 2, ('risk', 'response'): 2, ('analysis', 'process'): 1, ('process', 'contingency'): 1, ('reserve', 'calculated'): 1, ('calculated', 'project'): 1, ('project', 'cost'): 1}","{('project', 'contingency', 'reserve'): 2, ('contingency', 'reserve', 'required'): 2, ('analysis', 'process', 'contingency'): 1, ('process', 'contingency', 'reserve'): 1, ('contingency', 'reserve', 'calculated'): 1, ('reserve', 'calculated', 'project'): 1, ('calculated', 'project', 'cost'): 1, ('project', 'cost', 'schedule'): 1, ('cost', 'schedule', 'risk'): 1, ('schedule', 'risk', 'analysis'): 1}","{'project': 5, 'analysis': 4, 'contingency': 4, 'reserve': 4, 'risk': 4, 'result': 4, 'provide': 3, 'required': 3, 'plan': 3, 'cost': 2}"
