0,9.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Monitor and Control Risks Process,,"The primary objectives of risk monitoring and controlling are to track identiﬁ ed risks, monitor residual risks,
identify new risks, ensure that risk response plans are executed at the appropriate time, and evaluate their
effectiveness throughout the project life cycle.
In addition to tracking and managing the risk response actions, the effectiveness of all of the Project
Risk Management processes should be reviewed to provide improvements to the management of the current
project as well as future ones.
For each risk or set of risks for which a contingent response has been deﬁ ned, the corresponding set of
trigger conditions should have been speciﬁ ed. It is the responsibility of the action owner to ensure that these
conditions are effectively monitored and that the corresponding actions are carried out as deﬁ ned, in a timely
manner.
Once the Plan Risk Responses process is complete, all of the approved unconditional response actions
should have been included and deﬁ ned in the current project management plan. The ﬁ rst action of risk
monitoring and controlling is to check whether this is the case and take any appropriate action if necessary,
such as invoking the change management process with respect to any missing actions. This will then ensure
that the agreed-upon actions are carried out within the normal project execution framework.
The risk owners and risk action owners need to be briefed on any changes that may affect their
responsibilities. Effective communication needs to be maintained between them and the project manager so
that the designated stakeholders accept accountability for controlling the potential outcomes of speciﬁ c risks,
apply their best efforts to track the associated trigger conditions and carry out the agreed-upon responses in
a timely manner.
In addition to the response actions and trigger conditions, a mechanism for measuring the effectiveness
of the response is provided by the Plan Risk Responses process. The risk action owner should keep the risk
owner aware of the status of the response actions so that the risk owner can decide when the risk has been
effectively dealt with, or whether additional actions need to be planned and implemented.

CHAPTER 9 − MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS
As the project progresses, additional information becomes available and the project environment may
change as some risks occur, whether foreseen or unforeseen, and others become or cease to be relevant.
The planning should therefore be kept current and the project manager should ensure that periodic risk
reassessment, including risk identiﬁ cation, analysis, and response planning, is repeated at reasonable intervals,
or in response to project events—without generating excessive administrative overhead. Typical reasons for
risk reassessment are:
Occurrence of a major or unexpected risk,
•
Need to analyze a complex change request,
•
Phase end review,
•
Project re-planning or major plan elaboration, and
•
Periodic review to ensure that the information remains current.
•
In the event of major organizational changes, risk management planning may need to be revisited prior to
reassessing the risks.
In addition to the regular status reviews, periodic audits should be performed to determine strengths and
weaknesses in handling risks within the project. This should entail identifying any barriers to effectiveness or
keys to success in risk management, recognition of which could lead to improvements in risk management of
the current or future projects.
At the end of the project, an integrated analysis of the risk management process should be carried out
with a focus on long-term process improvements. This analysis consolidates the ﬁ ndings of the periodic
audits to identify lessons that would be applicable in general to a large proportion of the organization’s
projects in the future, such as appropriate levels of resources, adequate time for the analysis, use of tools,
level of detail, etc.
At project closure, the project manager should ensure that a description has been given of the closure of
every risk in the risk register, for example: (a) did not occur; (b) occurred and contingency plan invoked; or (c)
occurred and impact to the project scope (i.e., time, cost, and quality).
The output of the audit of the risk management process should be consolidated with speciﬁ c information
with respect to the project’s experience of risks, and any generally applicable guidelines for the organization
should be highlighted and potential actions proposed for applying them. This can lead to an update to the
corresponding organizational process assets.
An overview of the steps involved in the Monitor and Control Risks process is given in Figure 9-1.

which risks are handled as they occur, and by the number or characteristics of such events. It is therefore

the responses, be communicated at regular intervals and in an honest manner adapted to the needs of each

in the risk management plan.
The goal is to ensure that the signiﬁ cant risk management information is recorded to provide concrete data
to the lessons learned process for inclusion in a lessons learned document, report, or other communication
vehicle. Typical information includes the following:
For each identiﬁ ed risk or type of risk, whether it occurred, and, if so, when and how often. All
•
relevant data should be recorded: impact, effectiveness of detection and of response, and any
unplanned, additional actions that were carried out.
Effectiveness of avoidance or exploitation actions.
•
Effectiveness of transfer and sharing actions.
•
Unexpected or undocumented risks which occurred and data about them.
•
Effectiveness of risk mitigation and enhancement actions.
•
Occurrence of accepted threats or opportunities.
•
Consolidated information should be provided on the level of effort expended. Costs and beneﬁ ts to the
project of risk management activities should also be provided.
This information will need to be archived and indexed in a manner that will facilitate retrieval for easy
review during the project, at closure, and for future projects, when the need arises.

APPENDIX A
GUIDELINES FOR A PMI PRACTICE STANDARD
A.1  Introduction
A PMI practice standard is characterized as follows:
Each practice standard provides guidelines on the mechanics (e.g., nuts and bolts, basics,
•
fundamentals, step-by-step usage guide, how it operates, how to do it) of some signiﬁ cant process
(input, tool, technique, or output) that is relevant to a project manager.
A practice standard does not necessarily mirror the life-cycle phases of many projects; however, an
•
individual practice standard may be applicable to the completion of one or more phases within a
project.
A practice standard does not necessarily mirror the Knowledge Areas within
•
A Guide to the Project
Management Body of Knowledge ( PMBOK ®  Guide –Fourth Edition), although an individual practice
standard will provide sufﬁ cient detail and background for one or more of the inputs, tools and
techniques, and/or outputs. Therefore, practice standards are not required to use the name of any
Knowledge Area.
Each practice standard should include information on what the signiﬁ cant process is and does,
•
why it is signiﬁ cant, how to perform it, when it should be performed, and, if necessary for further
clariﬁ cation, who should perform it.
Each practice standard should include information that is accepted and applicable for most projects
•
most of the time within the project management community. Processes that are generally restricted or
applicable to one industry, country, or companion profession (i.e., an  application area ) may be included
as an appendix for informational purposes, rather than as part of the practice standard. With strong
support and evidence, an application area-speciﬁ c process may be considered as an extension practice
standard, in the same manner as extensions to the  PMBOK ®  Guide –Fourth Edition are considered.
Each practice standard will beneﬁ t from the inclusion of examples and templates. It is best when an
•
example or template includes a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses. A background description
may be necessary to put this discussion in the appropriate context. The examples should be aligned with
the relevant information in the standard or its appendix and placed in proximity to that information.
All practice standards shall be written in the same general style and format.
•
E ach practice standard project will be aligned with or reference other practice standards, as needed.
•
Each practice standard will be consistent with the
•
PMBOK ®  Guide –Fourth Edition.
Each practice standard is intended to be more prescriptive than the
•
PMBOK ®  Guide –Fourth Edition.","The i nail control action of risk monitoring and controlling is to record actual data for future used This includes all of the relevant information relating to risk
