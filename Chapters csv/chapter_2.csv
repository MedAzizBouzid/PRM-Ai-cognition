1,,"The word “risk” is used in many ways in everyday language and in various specialist disciplines. Its use
in the  PMBOK  ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition is consistent with other risk management standards and process
descriptions. The deﬁ nition of project risk given in the  PMBOK  ®  Guide – Fourth Edition is as follows:
Project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative
effect on a project’s objectives.
This deﬁ nition includes two key dimensions of risk: uncertainty and effect on a project’s objectives. When
assessing the importance of a project risk, these two dimensions must both be considered. The uncertainty
dimension may be described using the term “probability” and the effect may be called “impact” (though other
descriptors are possible, such as “likelihood” and “consequence”).
The deﬁ nition of risk includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described, and
more general conditions which are less speciﬁ c but also may give risk to uncertainty.   The deﬁ nition of project
risk also encompasses uncertain events which could have a negative effect on a project’s objectives, as
well as those which could have a positive effect. These two types of risk are called, respectively, threats and
opportunities. It is important to address both threats and opportunities within a uniﬁ ed Project Risk Management
process. This allows for the gain of synergies and efﬁ ciencies such as addressing both in the same analyses
and coordinating the responses to both if they overlap or can reinforce each other.

CHAPTER 2 − PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS
Risks are uncertain future events or conditions which may or may not occur, but which would matter if they
did occur. It is important to distinguish risks from risk-related features, such as cause and effect. Causes are
events or circumstances which currently exist or are certain to exist in the future and which might give rise
to risks. Effects are conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project
objectives if the associated risk occurs. The cause-risk-effect chain can be used in a structured risk statement
or risk description to ensure that each of these three elements is properly described (see Section 5.3).
When a risk event occurs, it ceases to become uncertain. Threats which occur may be called issues or
problems; opportunities which occur may be called beneﬁ ts. Both issues/problems and beneﬁ ts entail project
management actions that are outside the scope of the Project Risk Management process.",The word risk is used in many ways in everyday language and in various specialist disciplines Its use in the amok i Guide i Fourth Edition is consistent with other risk management standards and process descriptions The de nation of project risk given in the amok i Guide i Fourth Edition is as follows Project risk is an uncertain event or condition that if it occurs has a positive or a negative effect on a projects objectives This de nation includes two key dimensions of risk uncertainty and effect on a projects objectives When assessing the importance of a project risk these two dimensions must both be considered The uncertainty dimension may be described using the term probability and the effect may be called impact though other descriptors are possible such as likelihood and “consequence”).

2,,"It is useful to consider project risk at two levels: individual risks and overall project risk.
Individual risks are speciﬁ c events or conditions that might affect project objectives. An individual risk
may positively or negatively affect one or more of the project objectives, elements, or tasks. Understanding
individual risks can assist in determining how to apply effort and resources to enhance the chances of project
success. Day-to-day Project Risk Management focuses on these individual risks in order to enhance the
prospects of a successful project outcome.
Overall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. Overall project risk is
more than the sum of individual risks on a project, since it applies to the whole project rather than to individual
elements or tasks. It represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project
outcome. It is an important component of strategic decision-making, program and portfolio management,
and project governance where investments are sanctioned or cancelled and priorities are set. At these higher
levels, it is necessary to set realistic targets for the cost and duration of a project, establish the contingency
reserve levels required to protect the project stakeholders, set appropriate project priorities, and judge whether
the risk of overall success is increasing or decreasing as implementation advances.","It is useful to consider project risk at two levels individual risks and overall project risk Individual risks are specie c events or conditions that might affect project objectives An individual risk may positively or negatively affect one or more of the project objectives elements or tasks Understanding individual risks can assist in determining how to apply effort and resources to enhance the chances of project success Day-to-day Project Risk Management focuses on these individual risks in order to enhance the prospects of a successful project outcome Overall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole Overall project risk is more than the sum of individual risks on a project since it applies to the whole project rather than to individual elements or tasks It represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome It is an important component of strategic decision-making, program and portfolio management and project governance where investments are sanctioned or cancelled and priorities are set At these higher levels it is necessary to set realistic targets for the cost and duration of a project establish the contingency reserve levels required to protect the project stakeholders set appropriate project priorities and judge whether the risk of overall success is increasing or decreasing as implementation advances",it is useful to consider project risk at two levels individual risks and overall project risk individual risks are specie c events or conditions that might affect project objectives an individual risk may positively or negatively affect one or more of the project objectives elements or tasks understanding individual risks can assist in determining how to apply effort and resources to enhance the chances of project success day to day project risk management focuses on these individual risks in order to enhance the prospects of a successful project outcome overall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole overall project risk is more than the sum of individual risks on a project since it applies to the whole project rather than to individual elements or tasks it represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome it is an important component of strategic decision making program and portfolio management and project governance where investments are sanctioned or cancelled and priorities are set at these higher levels it is necessary to set realistic targets for the cost and duration of a project establish the contingency reserve levels required to protect the project stakeholders set appropriate project priorities and judge whether the risk of overall success is increasing or decreasing as implementation advances,consider project risk levels risks project risk risks events conditions affect project objectives risk project objectives elements tasks understanding risks assist determining apply effort resources enhance chances project success day day project risk management focuses risks order enhance prospects project outcome project risk represents effect uncertainty project project risk sum risks project applies project elements tasks represents exposure stakeholders implications variations project outcome component decision making program portfolio management project governance investments sanctioned cancelled priorities set levels set targets cost duration project establish contingency reserve levels required protect project stakeholders set project priorities judge risk success increasing decreasing implementation advances,"{('project', 'risk'): 5, ('risk', 'project'): 3, ('project', 'objective'): 2, ('element', 'task'): 2, ('project', 'outcome'): 2, ('consider', 'project'): 1, ('risk', 'level'): 1, ('level', 'risk'): 1, ('risk', 'risk'): 1, ('risk', 'event'): 1}","{('consider', 'project', 'risk'): 1, ('project', 'risk', 'level'): 1, ('risk', 'level', 'risk'): 1, ('level', 'risk', 'project'): 1, ('risk', 'project', 'risk'): 1, ('project', 'risk', 'risk'): 1, ('risk', 'risk', 'event'): 1, ('risk', 'event', 'condition'): 1, ('event', 'condition', 'affect'): 1, ('condition', 'affect', 'project'): 1}","{'project': 17, 'risk': 12, 'level': 3, 'set': 3, 'objective': 2, 'element': 2, 'task': 2, 'enhance': 2, 'success': 2, 'day': 2}"
3,,"The risk attitudes of the project stakeholders determine the extent to which an individual risk or overall
project risk matters. A wide range of factors inﬂ uence risk attitude. These include the scale of the project
within the range of stakeholders’ overall activities, the strength of public commitments made about the
performance of the project, and the stakeholders’ sensitivity to issues such as environmental impacts,
industrial relations, and other factors. Stakeholder risk attitudes usually result in a desire for increased
certainty in project outcomes, and may express a preference for one project objective over another. How risk
is regarded is usually also strongly inﬂ uenced by an organization’s culture. Different organizations are more
or less open, and this often impacts the way risk management can be applied.

Understanding stakeholders’ attitudes toward risk is an important component of risk management planning
that precedes risk identiﬁ cation and analysis, in order to optimize both project success and stakeholder
satisfaction with the project’s results. These attitudes should be identiﬁ ed and managed proactively and
deliberately throughout the Project Risk Management process. They may differ from one project to another
for the same stakeholders and will usually differ from one group of stakeholders to another. In fact a single
stakeholder may adopt different risk attitudes at various stages in the same project.

not, new risks will arise or be discovered, and the characteristics of those already identiﬁ ed may change. As a
result, the Project Risk Management processes should be repeated and the corresponding plans progressively
elaborated throughout the lifetime of the project.
To ensure that Project Risk Management remains effective, the identiﬁ cation and analysis of risks should
be revisited periodically, the progress on risk response actions should be monitored, and the action plans
adjusted accordingly. If external circumstances change signiﬁ cantly, it may also be necessary to revisit the risk
management planning process.
