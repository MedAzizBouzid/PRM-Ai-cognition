has a positive or negative effect on a project’s objectives.” Project objectives include scope, schedule, cost,
and quality.
Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence, and provide

8,,"Project Risk Management is not an optional activity: it is essential to successful project management.
It should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents. In
this way, it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project, in every phase and in every
process group.
Many of the project management processes address planning the project, from concept to ﬁ nal design
and from procurement through daily management of execution and close-out. These processes often
assume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and, therefore, they need to include treatment of
project risks.
Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it
builds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance, project scheduling provides dates
and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty.
Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates
and critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project.
Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary,
Project Risk Management requires that these project management processes (e.g. scheduling, budgeting, and
change management) be performed at the level of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds
the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk
into account. For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and
schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of conﬁ dence
for meeting project objectives.

CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION
There is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects. In the early stages of a project, the level of
risk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not
mean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather, there may be different
ways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized, the
more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be.
A risk management approach is applicable throughout a project’s life cycle. The earlier in the project life
cycle that the risks are recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk
management continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available
about all aspects and components of the project and its environment, such as stakeholders, scope, time, and
cost, as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project ﬂ exibility and
knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop.
It is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions, agreements, and contracts in
place, the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced.
During project execution, risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new
risks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed, as well as check for existing
risks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for
the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future.
Finally, throughout the project and during project closure, risk-related lessons are reviewed in order to
contribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management
practice.",Project Risk Management is not an optional activity it is essential to successful project management It should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and

9,,"Project Risk Management is a valuable component of project management and it enhances the value of
the other project management processes. As with all of these processes, Project Risk Management should be
conducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies. In addition, like the other
processes involved in project management, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is
appropriate to the project. Project Risk Management should recognize the business challenges as well as the
multi-cultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture
projects and customers, suppliers, and workforces spread around the globe.
Changes in the project management plan that result from the Project Risk Management process may
require decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel, establish or modify budgets,
make commitments to others outside the project, interact with regulators, and comply with the rules of
accounting and law. Project Risk Management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and
external requirements.

CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION
Project Risk Management should always be conducted on an ethical basis, in keeping with the Project
Management code of ethics or conduct. Honesty, responsibility, realism, professionalism and fair dealing
with others are among the characteristics of successful Project Risk Management. Effective Project Risk
Management beneﬁ ts from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders. This enables agreement
among stakeholders that Project Risk Management in general, and risk identiﬁ cation, analysis, and response,
in particular, should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other
unreasonable inﬂ uences.
Project Risk Management should be conducted on all projects. The degree, level of detail, sophistication of
tools, and amount of time and resources applied to Project Risk Management should be in proportion to the
characteristics of the project under management and the value that they can add to the outcome. Thus, a large
project that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources, time, and
attention to Project Risk Management than would a smaller, short-term, internal project that can be conducted
in the background with a ﬂ exible deadline.
Each of the Project Risk Management processes should be scaled to be appropriate to the project under
management during the Plan Risk Management process and reviewed periodically to determine if the decisions
made in that process remain appropriate.","Project Risk Management is a valuable component of project management and it enhances the value of the other project management processes As with all of

CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION
Speciﬁ c criteria for success of each Project Risk Management process are listed in the chapters dealing
with those processes. The general criteria for success include:
• Recognize the Value of Risk Management    — Project Risk Management should be recognized
as a valuable discipline that provides a positive potential return on investment for organizational
management, project stakeholders (both internal and external), project management, and team
members.
• Individual Commitment/Responsibility    — Project participants and stakeholders should all accept
responsibility for undertaking risk-related activities as required. Risk management is everybody’s
responsibility.
• Open and Honest Communication    — Everyone should be involved in the Project Risk Management
process.  Any actions or attitudes that hinder communication about project risk reduce the effectiveness
of Project Risk Management in terms of proactive approaches and effective decision-making.
• Organizational Commitment    — Organizational commitment can only be established if risk
management is aligned with the organization’s goals and values. Project Risk Management may
require a higher level of managerial support than other project management disciplines because
handling some of the risks will require approval of or responses from others at levels above the
project manager.
• Risk Effort Scaled to Project    — Project Risk Management activities should be consistent with the value
of the project to the organization and with its level of project risk, its scale, and other organizational
constraints. In particular, the cost of Project Risk Management should be appropriate to its potential
value to the project and the organization.
• Integration with Project Management   — Project Risk Management does not exist in a vacuum,
isolated from other project management processes. Successful Project Risk Management requires
the correct execution of the other project management processes.
These critical success factors for Project Risk Management are illustrated in Figure 1-2.",Figure 1-2.
